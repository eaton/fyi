    <main><img src="under-construction.jpeg" alt="An Andy Capp cartoon strip from the late 1960s, retitled “Eaton, FYI.” In the first panel, Andy Capp reclines on a couch, reading the newspaper. “I see the old boy’s pretending to blog again,” he shouts. “I reckon it’s some sort of headless business,” Flo replies. After a moment of thinking, Andy asks, “Yer figure there’s a body?” and Flo answers, “Never can tell, luv. Enough React an’ nobody’ll know the difference.”"/>
