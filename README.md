# Eaton, FYI

Jeff Eaton's grossly over-engineered home page on the web.

What was originally a tidy little one-pager turned into a large-scale internet history project, tracking down archived versions or hard copies of nearly everything I've written, published, or created over the past however-many decades and turning them into a homepage-like, bloggish hub of nerd.

## Key Elements

- HTMLified versions of the talks and presentations I've given over the past 20 years.
- Copies of articles I've written for other sites and publications over the past 35 years years.
- Ridiculously large reading library of books, articles, and other media with notes and excerpts.
- Archive of shared and bookmarked links dating back to the late 90s.
- Posts from the blogs, personal sites, and bloglike social media presences I've run since the 90s.
- Project timeline of zines, freelance writing, software, web sites, consulting, and various other gigs over the past 35 years.
- Snapshots and transcripts of podcast appearances, interviews, and other appearances.
- Archive of select photos shared from Flickr, Instagram, and similar services.

## Ridiculousness

- Statistical breakdown of every email I've sent or received in the 21st century.
- Stats and linkrot timeline for the thousands of bookmarks I saved over the last several decades.
- A decade and a half of archived tweets from my @eaton, @schmeaton, and assorted other novelty accounts.
- Timelines to contextualize various my own posts with contemporaneous news and events.
- Machine-learning powered cross referencing of the whole mess
