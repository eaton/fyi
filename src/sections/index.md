Hey, there! I'm Jeff Eaton.

I help organizations understand their content and improve the systems they use to create, manage, publish, and measure it. I'm a founding partner at [Autogram](https://autogram.is), a sometimes [software developer](https://github.com/eaton), a frequent [speaker](/talks/), and a magpie for interesting things.

This site is the rough skeleton of an archive that includes about three decades of my writing, reading, project artifacts, and other digital flotsam. The cliche is true: it is *very much under construction*.
