## Content

* Most of the writing on the site was done in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) or, more recently, [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).
* Talks and presentations were created in Keynote: It may not be perfect, but at least it's not Google Slides.

## Design

* Bare bones HTML and [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) are currently the only gesture towards design.

## Tech

* [A varied bundle of custom tools](https://github.com/topics/eatonfyi) written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) were used to ingest old journal entries, dusty laptop backups, and archived blogs.
* The data itself is stored in [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com), an open-source multi-modal database that combines semi-structured document storage with powerful graph traversal queries.
* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), the static site generator, is responsible for building the static site from that data.

## History

* Past versions of this site stretch back to the mid 90s; [some can be seen here](https://eaton-fyi-cold-storage.netlify.app).
