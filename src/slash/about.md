### Somewhat flavorful

Jeff Eaton is a founding partner at [Autogram](https://autogram.is), and a digital strategist with more than 25 years of experience in content architecture, editorial workflow, and digital publishing. In 1983, he used a Fisher-Price Printing Press to publish a neighborhood newspaper â€” today, he helps with large and small companies design and refine their own publishing platforms.

He's worked with clients like Sony/BMG Music, IBM, World Wrestling Entertainment, The Federal Reserve Bank, Verizon Wireless and MSNBC to untangle their complex content. He looks forward to the day when all the PDFs have finally been converted.
