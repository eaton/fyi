It's always fun working on some code, finding a problem, and realizing -- after a couple hours of work -- that your company's core product, the one that's currently in the field with customers, *should never have run correctly in the first place.* It's like watching *The Sixth Sense*. Or driving your car to the grocery store only to have it stall -- then getting out, looking under the hood, and realizing that *it's never had an engine at all,* and is powered by a large wheel of cheese connected to the radiator. Fixing the problem may be straightforward -- it's obvious what's wrong -- but you're struck by a sense of wonder. "How," you ask yourself, "Did I drive around town for TWO YEARS in a cheese-based automobile?"

Some mysteries are too much for me to comprehend.
