So much rebuilding and reinstalling and re-ripping of MP3s and growling at Partition Magic and lamenting the time it takes to format 140 gigs of disk later... my Win2K system is back up and running.

Freelance work now continues unhampered by Nimda evilness.

It's amazing how much crap a computer builds up that you don't even think about. It's not just your apps or your files, it's your entire workflow. The favorites, the context-menu hacks, the registry tweaks, the drivers, everything. Egad. I want to back it all up to DVD so my system will be frozen in stable perfection!

For those in similar circumstances, I recommend hitting the [MS Security Updates Site](http://www.goats.com/archive/001102.html) as well.
