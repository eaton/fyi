it's been coming for a long time, and we all knew it would arrive... sigh. the death of [suck](http://www.suck.com) seems to be final. heard a mention of it on another site, hit the url to see if it was true... and it seems the site is no longer alive, even. polly esther! ambrose beers! the giant canadian crack rabbit! what will we do without you?

man. i miss my filler already.
