I've worked a 60+ hour week. Fixed innumerable defects. I've got portions of the app working that had baffled us for weeks. It's party time!

And 10 minutes ago, I put in my 2 weeks notice.

Strange and surreal; I believe it was the right decision, and I don't regret it, but it's another step into the unknown. All who read -- prayer is appreciated. Thanks.
