[It's British Telecom's timeline for the future. Yay!](http://www.btexact.com/white_papers/downloads/WP106.pdf)

[Hilights](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20020217/tc_nm/life_britain_future_dc_2&cid=581) include retinal implants linked to external cameras in 2004, 'Smart Barbies' demanding their own allowances in 2003, an AI earning a masters degree in 2014 and winning a nobel prise in 2018, and room temperature superconductors in 2020.

Most of the ideas seem a little ambitious, but it is some interesting stuff... For comparison, [Havana Modern's](http://www.havana-mod.com) version of the future doesn't even have AIs recognized as sentient until the 2050's.

Bear in mind that these bits of wisdom come from the company that tried to patent the hyperlink...
