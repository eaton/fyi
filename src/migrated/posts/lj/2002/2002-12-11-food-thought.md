Interesting story posted to [Kuro5hin](http://www.kuro5hin.org) today. The subject? [How to use the 'net anonymously.](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/12/10/213152/57) The author's naivete about technical solutions to technical problems was smacked down pretty quickly by the K5 crew's assorted responses. But the ensuing discussion raises some very interesting and unsettling questions.

The question ultimately boils down to, "How would we handle a 1984 situation?" It's especially distressing when you realize how dependent we've become on the 'net for communication. Hmm.

Who's up for a stegonography challenge to limber up for the Big Game?
