Almost everyone these days is convinced that padded estimates (the practice of adding time to account for meetings, delays, and unknown variables when you estimate a task for software development) are a good thing.

Joel, of Joel On Software, seems to be complemplating a radical departure from this after reading some interesting books. [Check out his thoughts.](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021119.html) It's not necessarily fun to think about as a software dev, but it's worthin contemplating.
