[Bruce Sterling](http://lonestar.texas.net/~dub/sterling.html) has always been one of my favorite authors from the cyberpunk crowd. He [helped kick the genre off](http://www.io.com/~ftp/usr/shiva/SMOF-BBS/cheap.truth/), but he never got sucked into the myopic [Hipper Than Thou](http://www.qmw.ac.uk/~english/cbl/project/taz/cpunk.htm) contests that infect any 'artsy' genre. Earlier this month he wrote [an article for the Austin Chronicle](http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-03-01/screens_feature2.html) pontificating about new digital culture. It's not *news* to anyone who follows bleeding edge, but it's cool insightful, and full of great pull quotes.

> *The core demographic at SXSW is the woolly-eyed digital creative, a species of creature from way before the Boom. Those characters were never anywhere near the big IPOs. They were all fueled by sheer subcultural coolness.*
