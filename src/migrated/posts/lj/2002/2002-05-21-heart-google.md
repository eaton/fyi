Holy cow. [Google Sets](http://labs1.google.com/sets) is cool. It's a research technology being demo'd by google that takes a list of items, and semi-intelligently predicts the next X number of items in the set.

Sure, MS Excel can do that already, right? Give it 1 and 2, and it assumes 3. But only Google Groups takes 'Evangelion' and 'Cowboy Bebop'... and gives you Ranma, Gundam, and Lain. The possibilities for research (and unheard-of levels of procrastination) are mind boggling.
