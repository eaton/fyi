Both [Yahoo](http://video.search.yahoo.com) and [Google](http://video.google.com/) have announced video search services this morning. So far, Google seems to be concentrating on indexing television shows and closed-caption text for easy retrieval. They’re even cross-linking to Wikipedia articles. Yahoo, on the other hand, is trying to pull all those wacky video clips on the ‘net into the land of proper searching. A quick search for [Vanilla Ice](http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=vanilla+ice), for example, yields viral video lips and outtakes from old music videos.
