Greg Knaddison is working on [a list of statistics to track the health of the Drupal community](http://groups.drupal.org/node/6551). One of the stats mentioned was "Number of Ponies Eaton Owes Dries for Core Commits."

For the record, I am currently *four ponies* in the hole. Three of these ponies were accumulated during the early FormAPI 3 development and testing process. The fourth was lost to Dries during a secret high-stakes game of poker that resulted in the repositioning of the Primary Links menu in Drupal 6's standard page.tpl.php file.

This blog post will be updated in the future as more pony-debt is accumulated.
