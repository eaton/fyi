Storage space has always been a reliable indicator of the relentless march of technology. Our parents had ginormous washing machines that stored a couple hundred K, after all. This week, I grabbed a new cell phone. It's nice -- it's sleek and shiny and text messaging is easier, given its larger screen. Most impressive is the "Oh by the way" addition of a Mini-SD card reader to store photos and video clips recorded by the phone.

Fifteen years ago, I saved up $400 and purchased a 100MB SCSI hard drive in an external case the size of an old family Bible. I named it 'The Abyss' because it was inconceivable that it could ever be filled. Today, I paid $12 for a one gigabyte Mini-SD card the size of my pinky-nail. It cost less than lunch.

Of course, every time I stop to experience awe, someone has to go and one-up it. Asian World of Warcraft gold-farmers, for example, recently spammed a server by raining dwarves on the town square to spell out their URL. [Charlie Stross rightly points out that it's basically three decades of severe future shock packed into one anecdote.](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/07/unpacking_the_zeitgeist.html)
