ShackNews has an [interesting article](http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=527) about the crazy wheeling-and-dealing on EVE Online, a MMORPG space opera that feels more like a Fredrick Pohl novel than Tolkien.

Also amusing is the subtext of The Goons in the article. Anyone who's played a MMORPG knows these guys: the SomethingAwful Forum Goons, a roaming pack thousands strong. They're definitely a force to be reckoned with.
