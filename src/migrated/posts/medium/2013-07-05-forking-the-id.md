I write a lot.

Obviously, not all of it is good and not all of it is useful. On the average day, though, I fire off the equivalent of a novella in emails, technical write-ups, heated forum discussions, and blog posts (both professional and personal).

Back in the old days, the question of where to put your *stuff* had a simple answer: if you cared, you built a web site. Eventually "blog" replaced "web site" in that sentence for almost everyone, but the idea persisted that anyone who really valued their words would self-host. Today, it's more complicated. Self-hosting is still seductive for those of us who want complete control, but other services make it possible to tie into the *social graph* and important stuff like that.

To make things more complicated, the most prolific among us have multiple side projects -- branded sideblogs and parallel sites we maintain to preserve a particular voice or focus. I, for example, have a cobbled-together [Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub](http://angrylittletree.com/), two neglected [Drupal sites](http://predicate.org/) for [side-projects](http://growingupgoddy.com/), accounts on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/eaton) and [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/eaton), [a Tumblr](http://eaton.tumblr.com/) that I use to repost forum and message board discussions I want to preserve, an [extremely active Twitter account](http://twitter.com/eaton), a [Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/people/jeffeaton/) that's getting less attention than it used to, a host of articles and podcasts on [my company's site](http://www.lullabot.com/blog), andâ€¦ well, now Medium.

Medium is fantastic. It's gorgeous. The editing interface is a genuine pleasure to use, and its hyperfocus ensures that I'll never be tempted to screw around with templating or coding up a new feature when I should just be *writing.* But that's a curse, too: Medium may be super slick, but it offers few ways to connect with the larger World of My Stuff.

If I want to put together a portfolio site, it can't effectively pull from Medium. If I want to write an article with complex figures and footnotes, there's no way for me to add additional just-so handling to Medium. That constraint means that it will never be my *only* platform. Is that OK? Does it matter, given how fragmented my work is? Does the network of other writers using Medium make it valuable enough to merit more of my creative energy?

I don't know yet, but the first service that can provide clear and simple answers to *those* questions will really win my heart.
