At least, I think so. Today was a day of startlingly good surprises. Out web
site, as it happens, is /not/ built on a giant quicksand-pit of custom
CGIs... it's built on a giant quicksand-pit of custom CGIs on top of
/coldfusion!/ meaning, of course, that the essential stuff that would be
very very evil to rebuild will /not/ have to be rebuilt.

this, needless to say, was encouraging.

i swung by barnes and noble on the way home, picked up a copy of 'Mastering
ColdFusion 4.0' and bounced happily. in addition, the design firm that may
be handling the retooling of the site has more good experience than I had
thought. the Family Christian Stores site, the Navigators site, some large
corporate presences, things like that. The only thing that concerned me was
the lack of large /content/ driven sites rather than /image/ driven sites.
Time will tell.

more bread arrived tonight: no croissants, but a hefty bag full of french
bread. carbos for the world! just visit our house!
