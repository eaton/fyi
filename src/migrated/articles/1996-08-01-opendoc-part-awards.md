In the months since Apple released OpenDoc, software developers have flocked to the cutting-edge technology to create new and innovative Open Doc Parts (subsequently renamed "LiveObjects"). Recently, Apple recognized a dozen outstanding developers with the first-ever OpenDoc Part Awards. Parts were recognized in two categories: Human Interface and General Stability.

## Human Interface

This category showcased parts that adhere to Apple's newest interface guidelines. Because OpenDoc's user interface is "document-centered" rather than "application-centered," users encounter significant changes even at the most basic level. The ubiquitous Quit command, for example, does not exist in OpenDoc. Instead, users simply close the document they are working on, and the OpenDoc parts close transparently and automatically. OpenDoc includes other subtle interface changes, and part developers must respond to them correctly and consistently if users are to benefit. "[These winning parts] are great models of how to implement the OpenDoc user experience," concluded Apple's OpenDoc team.

## Stability

Most OpenDoc parts are quite new; many are still under development, with "beta" versions being distributed to demonstrate concepts. The Stability category recognized OpenDoc parts that performed reliably even in their early stages, which allowed Apple to test OpenDoc with a variety of software components.

## Stability Winners

- *Outliner*, by Eclipse Services
- *Tiger Translator*, by SoftLine, Inc.
- *ImageMuseum*, by Planet Computer

- *Route 66*, by Route 66 Software

Most notable were Eclipse Systems' *Outliner* and Theta Group's *diF Database Parts*, each of which received recognition in both categories. With these and other cutting-edge parts entering the market, Apple's OpenDoc continues to gain momentum.
