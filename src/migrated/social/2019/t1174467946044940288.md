Disheartening to see the IA Institute closing its doors; doubly so because @elreiss' lawsuit was a transparent attempt to dig up information on anyone who had reported or complained about his pattern of harassment at events.

Conferences don't take action against fixtures and old-timers in their communities lightly; organizers tend to bend over backwards to protect the greybeards. Often, at small events, those tasked with keeping things safe have less power and clout than those violating the CoC.

When The IA Summit (now the IA Conference) banned Eric for CoC violations, they didn't publicize it; the only reason I put together what had happened was by knowing people who've been on the receiving end of his behavior there and at other events.

Even that is a testament to the nature of the problem. A guy with a history of harassment so long that established figures in the industry were on the receiving end *before* they were established. And it was still a "missing stair" situation that newcomers had no idea about.

If there's one good thing about his legal action and the subsequent closure of the IA Institute, it's that Eric took what was previously a backchannel warning, something concerned con organizers had to "handle" to keep attendees safeâ€¦ and put it in public view.
