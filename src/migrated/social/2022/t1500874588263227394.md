Once a software project gets large enough that it's being *marketed,* it becomes tremendously difficult to get straight answers about the opinion the product has about its domain — i.e., what problems it sees as fundamental ones to solve and what angle it approaches from.

That's often treated as synonymous with features or capabilities or documentation but as a project scales up fewer people retain a holistic "Why like this?" and more people are also invested in "It's good for everything" boosterism.

One of the interesting things about being listed as a "partner" at an "agency" that sometimes deals with "software projects" is attracting new and interesting kinds of LinkedIn pitches and sales calls… We advise clients on stuff, so people want to "help us."

There are absolutely "worst products" but no such thing as "best products" — it's all about finding good fits for needs and approaches and resources etc. Having an opinionated take on a problem space and owning a strong solution to the problem *as you see it*, matters a lot.

Being able to articulate that "as you see it" part is critical. Everybody will say their product is *better than everyone else's,* some can even talk about *why,* but I want to know who it *wouldn't* be good for and why.

Not as some sort of oblique gotcha question or "what's your greatest weakness" maneuver, but because understanding both sides of that perspective matters.
