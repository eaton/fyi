With sufficient levels of discipline, personnel, communication, and processing power, literally any form of storage can be an effective content repository. JPEGs full of morse code can be parsed. Binary data can be encoded in audio signals.

The question is, “given the clarity, discipline, and resources at our disposal, what way of storing and managing this stuff serves our needs efficiently?”

Given emergent unanticipated needs, team members will always figure out ways to “misuse” the model; sometimes it’s about education but it’s almost always a signal about an unmet need. Either a need for new tools, or for more clarity re the purpose of what’s already in the model.

Or, sometimes, the need to shrug and say, “Well, they put a weather warning in the birthday announcement entity. It did what they needed, and it didn’t break anything else. Let’s keep an eye on it for the future.”

As the age of a deployed system increases, the probability of someone putting CSS into the zip code field approaches 1.

Corollary: As the size of the organization increases, the probability of that being a business critical use case also approaches 1.
