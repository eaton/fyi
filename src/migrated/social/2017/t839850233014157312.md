Interesting thing about working with structured content â€” the Tech comm and Marketing comm worlds are starting to share ideas. But in my experience, it's the highly highly data-oriented product data parts of the marketing comms world that's really getting into it.

The third group that hasn't seen as many gains (yet) is the editorial/high throughput publishing world. They have a lot of overlap with the marketing comms world there, too, but definitely on the "microsite/content marketing/messaging" side.

All of this to say I'm pretty sure I feel a venn diagram coming on.
