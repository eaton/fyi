Lots of interesting stuff being done with structured content happens at the extremes.

Using DITA to bang out the 34-language, single-source manual for a 777, say. Or adding mood metadata to a social network's micro posts.

They're usually covered breathlessly because it's cutting edge, and technically interesting, and impossible w/out structured data.

Meanwhile the majority of companies on the ground are dealing with: "Ugh, updating our legal disclaimers is such a pain."

Many have even been burnt by "philosophically correct" structured content implementations that made their day to day work much harder.

I am a huge believer, but the kind of structure that a project merits depends on the needs, not a platonic content ideal.
