Simple truth: If you aren't listening to &amp; crediting black feminists, It's hard to take your analysis of the political climate v. seriously.

Like, I am no expert. But I know enough to know that they've known what's up for a long long while. And if YOU say YOU'RE an expert…

If don't know of any, don't be embarrassed, just fix it! You can literally google 'Black Feminist Writers' and poke around.

Feel free to check out the Cliffs Notes versions first, get your bearings. Note names that keep coming up, read some of their essays online.

It's not a hidden secret, not a special club that requires a wizened guide—if you're an autodidactic nerd like me, the process is familiar!

And if you're not, lots of people have assembled really solid reading lists to help you go straight to the sources of thought &amp; analysis.
