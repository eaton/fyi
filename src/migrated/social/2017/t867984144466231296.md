An effective content model isn't just boxes, arrows, and spreadsheets. It has to reflect a shared cross-disciplinary understanding of:

1. The distinct kinds of content you create and manage, their unique purposes, and how they relate to each other
2. The individual properties that make up each piece of content, the rules that govern them, and information about where they come from
3. The ways you organize that content — behind the scenes, and to consumers/visitors/the audience.
4. The processes that content goes through as it’s developed, published, promoted, maintained — and sometimes retired.
5. The people and the roles responsible for it throughout its lifecycle
6. The goals you’re trying to accomplish with that content, and what you’re measuring to track your progress
