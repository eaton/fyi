I’ve started thinking about toxic behavior as user stories, rather than amorphous environmental effects.

Like, instead of giving everybody shit-umbrellas, how could we think about a service or software’s affordances for toxic user goals?

“As a user, I want to force Rosie O’Donnell to acknowledge how angry I am at her.”

“As a user, I want to see a celebrity I like drag someone who criticized their work.”

Like dark patterns, but for user intent.
