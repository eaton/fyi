Prompted by @doriantaylor's excellent piece on Agile as an industry trauma-response ([https://doriantaylor.com/agile-as-trauma](https://doriantaylor.com/agile-as-trauma)) I've been revisiting Fred Brooks' The Mythical Man Month. It's always jarring how timely the problems and insights are, even when he's talking about OS/360 war stories.

In particular, I've been thinking a lot about the tendency of different disciplines (design, content, engineering in particular) to argue that they should be Running The Show™ of large projects.

Taylor's discussions of "Conceptual Integrity" — the quality of a system being self-consistent in its architecture, implementation, operation, etc — talk a lot about how this quality suffers when different pieces are conceived and made by different individuals w/different visions

It's no wonder that small, focused teams of cross-functional "unicorns" produce work that has more of that "conceptual integrity." Coordinating many people is hard. Coordinating many people across different *disciplines* is doubly hard.

The difficulty isn't just in the growing pile of "chatter" a large team creates, or the complexity of the system itself, it's also in getting a consistent and shared vision of what the system aught to be and how it aught to accomplish that.
