my favorite data visualizations, in order of how often I try to use them whether or not they are appropriate

Sunburst Rose Diagrams â€” great for "where is all the space on my hard drive going" and "where does most of the content on our site live?" where hierarchy, volume, and composition matter and you want to be able to zoom in and out. Also pretty.[https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/sunburst_diagram.html](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/sunburst_diagram.html)

Chord Diagrams! For when you want to visualize inter-relationships between a bunch of things and don't mind that it looks like the back of someone's needlework sampler. [https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/chord_diagram.html](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/chord_diagram.html)

Radar Charts! For when you have a couple consistent points of data for a bunch of items, and you want to compare all of the items at a glance. It turns each item into a happy, bursty little polgyon.

Finally, Fishbone Diagrams: the visualization for when a bunch of things went wrong and something exploded, but you kind of need a flowchart to explain why. [https://fishbonediagram.org](https://fishbonediagram.org)
