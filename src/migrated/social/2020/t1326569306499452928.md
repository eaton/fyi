In extremely non-political news, prepare for a brief soliloquy on the flexibility of various cloud services when you need *both* family *and* team level flexibility to avoid a sea of duplicate logins

Both my partner and I have reasonable amounts of complexity in how we wrangle files and use our devices. The usual mix of desk/laptop devices for each of us, and mobile/tablet stuff. Some play, lots of work. She's a writer and editor, I do IA/Tech/Strategy stuff.

As a lot of folks know, I also do @autogram_is with @karenmcgrane and @beep, so "running a small business" and "wrangling client stuff" is part of that, too.

Most of the time, the services I need fall into "Catherine and I use them" OR "Autogram uses them"…

In those situations, most cloud services have decent Team or Family plans that centralize billing and make things simple to manage. But when *both* apply, it gets tangled.

This is top of mind because Dropbox just announced a 'Dropbox Family Plan' ([https://www.dropbox.com/plans](https://www.dropbox.com/plans)). For the moment, I think it might just make sense to keep *everyone* on personal plans and rely on shared folders, but that's disappointing.

The absolute *king* of cloud services is @1Password — you can create a personal account, upgrade it to a family account, invite guests to share specific one-off collections of credentials, OR set up a team account… each seat of which comes with a free family account.

And… let us not speak of Google Drive.

All of this, of course, gets flat out *non-euclidean* if you are working as an independent contractor on multiple teams simultaneously. Either you hope each team has their act together, or you essentially form an LLC and put on your I Do Processes Now hat. c'est la vie

(I'm breaking a million rules by spawning off a sub-thread here, but: Google Drive is fantastic for organizing Google Cloud documents but in our experience it turns into a real tangle if used to manage *other* kinds of documents, especially if they're frequently edited)

i.e., keeping your Keynote decks in a Google Drive folder breaks down in a million ways; Dropbox has really truly mastered the "It's a folder that just appears everywhere" effect, Drive is much more "You can download and re-upload stuff easily"
