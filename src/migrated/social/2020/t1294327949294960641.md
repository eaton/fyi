Since 2006, I've worked with the amazing team at @lullabot to launch great sites, solve thorny problems, and build a digital strategy practice from the ground up. It's an emotional moment for me — after 14 years, today is my last day.

Together, @karenmcgrane, @beep, and I are forming @autogram_is, a strategic consultancy focused on the intersection of content management and services platforms, component-oriented design systems, and digital strategy and governance at scale.

That cluster of nouns is either mind-numbingly boring or *absolutely electrifying* depending on the kind of work you do! The seeds of our new venture were planted last year, when we began sharing notes about the most difficult problems our clients wrestled with.

Stuff like like decoupled content, improved tooling for design systems, and more focus on content strategy are encouraging… but the pieces rarely come together effectively. Usually, best practices happen in silos and new tools don't touch the underlying problems.

We're excited about the approaches we've been developing, and the value of tackling the problems collaboratively. If the stuff I mentioned sounds familiar, or you'd like to share some war stories, drop us a line. We'd love to talk — and make things better. [http://autogram.is](http://autogram.is)
