Almost a decade ago, @karenmcgrane and I were prepping for a talk about what people were optimistically calling "the mobile web." It was going to be more complicated than that, we thought.

"Have you seen @beep's draft?" she asked. It was, she said, going to *change things*.

The draft she was talking about was the first edition of Ethan Marcotte's "Responsive Web Design." He's writing about the anniversary on his blog this weekend, and it's worth reading. [https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/responsive-design-at-10/](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/responsive-design-at-10/)

He's the first to say that what he labeled "responsive design" wasn't revolutionary but evolutionary; combining techniques that web standards advocates and what we now call Front End Designers had been wrestling with for a long time to solve a new kind of problem.

Despite that humble framing, it's hard to overstate the impact that @beep has had on the world of web and digital publishing, even content management, because he did the hard work of boiling down those techniques into a set of easily-explained core practices.

Figuring out how to solve a tangly problem is a particular kind of "hard." Figuring out how to explain it to others, clearly and unambiguously, so everyone else can solve it, too, is another kind. Massive kudos to @beep and all the whip-smart folks who've built on his work, too.
