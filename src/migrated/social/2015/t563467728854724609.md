Great (fast!) trip to NYC this week. Lots of random thoughts about publishing &amp; digital content.

1. Lots of energy is put into "getting people to share." Little is put into exposing quality metadata to improve the shares that DO happen.
2. Decoupling content management/storage/delivery lets you innovate on the front end, but requires hard up-front planning of content structure. That means not just types/properties/relationships, but also strategy for aggregation and assembly of the individual content components.
3. Re-platforming is expensive, and big shifts (multichannel, responsive, etc) help sell new products or new versions of existing onesâ€¦ But replatforming ever 1-2 years isn't sustainable. Smart clients are weighing platform resilience across multiple industry shifts.
