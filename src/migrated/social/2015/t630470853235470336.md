Some of my favorite narrative atoms in digital content: Vox's StoryStreams, CNBC's use of actual tabular data vs. images, Medium's comments

The "Actual Tabular Data" thing is easy to overlook, but SO much news is published with hard numbers in a jpg.

And Medium's comments are a pretty bold departure: collapsible, inline commentary. Like crowdsourced footnotes.

StoryStreams? It's a little thing, but it takes "related content" and ties it right into Vox's voice/brand: providing context.

This has been your weekly installment of Eaton Rambles About Nitpicky Digital Publishing Stuff.
