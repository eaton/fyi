Gross Content Strategy Oversimplifications To Follow:

![](media://twitter/1021945598851858434-Di6uFtfW4AEde3n.mp4)

- MarComm uses advertising, targeted interactions, and visitor-relevant content to earn trust and positive feelings about a brand. Its cross-channel focus is ensuring expensive content assets are used efficiently and consistently, always steering consumers towards a transaction.
- EdComm includes news, entertainment, some educational institutions, etc. Content is the product they produce and sell, and its cross-channel concerns are focused on making more products available via more channels with limited resources.
- TechComm is traditionally associated with documentation, support, and training efforts. In multi/omnichannel, it focuses on making sure that content is accurate, consistent, and highly accessible whenever and wherever its audience needs — potentially including the sales process.

While all three camps share technologies and practices — and many projects dip into more than one of these camps — their primary goals and stress cases are often quite different.

At the risk of oversimplifying, #MarComm success is measured in sales of a product or service. #EdComm success is measured in production and distribution efficiency. #TechComm (at least in projects I've worked on) is often measured in reduced usage of expensive human support.
