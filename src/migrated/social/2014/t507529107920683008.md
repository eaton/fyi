An enduring content model needs to represent three key perspectives: Domain knowledge, presentation design, and audience/messaging.

Any modeling effort that leaves one (or two) of those out will skew in consistent, predictable ways.

Purely domain &amp; data-centric models are consistent but accumulate sedimentary layers of cruft, as they don't account for presentation needs.

When presentation design dominates, the model skews to "stuff to fill holes in the templates" -- effective, but scrapped in the next refresh

And when audience/messaging dominates, you basically get microsites: effective, tailored, very difficult to leverage past work as it evolves

An org that needs its work to endure and evolve effectively needs all three informing each other: they are complimentary.

A good model MUST evolve &amp; change, but when it works, it gives those three perspectives a shared language to navigate/negotiate the changes.
