Lots of thoughts and feels this last day in New Orleans. Final day of Drupalcon, there was a jazz band funeral parade for Drupal 6.

I generally dislike being “the guy who takes things too seriously”  … but I find myself still-troubled by the event.

Maybe it’s that I read the news of Zimmerman auctioning his gun? Maybe it’s the last time I was here, Katrina was still so fresh?

The funeral-celebration, with sadness and joy, is something real and profound and it is a way that people wrestle with deep loss. suffering.

I’ve got lots of feelings about the way our software community has evolved and changed, but… it wasn’t death. It was code. Business.
