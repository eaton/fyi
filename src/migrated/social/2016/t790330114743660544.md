AAVE is the best damn thing to happen to the English language in our era. It makes sense that broader (aka white) culture likes to adopt it.

But as @thetrudz and many others deftly point out, the did between “adoption” and “appropriation” is whether originators are reviled for it

i.e. treating white folks as modern &amp; hip for using language flourishes  we treat as “disqualifying ghettoness” in, say, a PoC job applicant

It’s the double standard that really helps the complexities of “appropriation” click for me &amp; why saying it’s just adoption misses the point

In conclusion [http://www.alternet.org/culture/cultural-appropriation-pho-lionel-shriver-jamie-oliver-marc-jacobs](http://www.alternet.org/culture/cultural-appropriation-pho-lionel-shriver-jamie-oliver-marc-jacobs) should prolly be tattooed on every social media manager who wedged “on fleek” into a product tweet
