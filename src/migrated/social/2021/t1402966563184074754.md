Just kicking off "Learning From The Language of LEGO" at @OmniXconf — nothing spells fun like mixing content strategy, systems thinking, and… LEGO!

Breaking things up into tinier pieces doesn't automatically solve content problems; the magic of LEGO bricks is the consistent system that makes *all of them work together*.

LEGO bricks are built around consistent measurements, ratios, and points of connection — it means new bricks work with old ones, and new *kinds and shapes* of bricks don't break the system, but extend it.

Complex structured content faces similar challenges; @lullabot and @GeorgiaGovTeam designed a set of components around consistent kinds of connections; that meant new component types can be added without re-engineering the whole system.

The principle of consistent connections and measurements has also allowed @LEGO_Group to develop new "sub-systems" to explore unique needs, markets, and mechanisms. TECHNIC sets added gears, pistons, and more — but "normal" sets could stay simple.

Five content architecture lessons from @LEGO_Group stand out:

- Invest in of consistent connections

- Use composition to deal with emergent needs

- Balance tailored structures with generic ones

- Experiment in isolated sub-systems

- Assume your needs will evolve over time.
