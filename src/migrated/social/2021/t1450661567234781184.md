It’s fascinating that this applies to the world of content architecture, too: the last decade or so in particular has put several divergent schools of thought on a collision course.

Cultural and generational shifts have made digital presence a non-negotiable for most organizations just as device proliferation and the rise of content marketing multiplied the effort needed to keep up with the Joneses.

Against that backdrop, high-variance art-directed marketing that happens to live in an HTML page is intermingling with highly structured materials optimized for multichannel distribution. Conflicting paradigms are mingling and even experts often struggle to square that circle.

A lot of energy is spent simply trying to articulate perspectives and explain naescent ideas in an environment where it’s uncertain if disagreements are *fundamental* or simply vocabulary-mismatch problems.

The importance of thoughtful, cross-community involvement is huge; the need has never been greater for people who do the work of distilling and explaining the diverse needs, challenges, and emerging solutions so that the community can both learn from each other AND push forward.
